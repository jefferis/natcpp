Title: Fast C++ functions for computational neuroanatomy
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Who wrote it
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: Fast functions implemented in C++ via Rcpp to support the
    neuroanatomy toolbox ('nat') ecosystem. These functions provide large 
    speed-ups for basic manipulation of neuronal skeletons over pure R functions
    found in the 'nat' package. The expectation is that end users will not use
    this package directly, but instead the 'nat' package will automatically use
    routines from this package when it is available to enable large performance
    gains.
